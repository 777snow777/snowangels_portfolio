                <p>Hi, my name is Snow.</p>
                <p>I am a coder and artist living on Lenapehoking land (New York City).
                <p>My work explores the collective imagination and everyday practice of world-building through storytelling.<br> I create websites, sculptures, and sound experiments that embody the interdependencies between digital and physical ecosystems. </p>

                    <h3  class="title">Dodder </h3><span class="date">Spring 2025 - Present</span>
                    <p>Dodder is a localized web archive, installed on a Raspberry Pi at community events in New York City. It holds stories of climate grief through field recordings and written entries.<br><br>
                    I designed this archive to only be accessible through physical presence, to those who have either been in direct contact with the Raspberry Pi or through devices connected to the same WiFi network as the raspberry pi. Inspired by concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth">Degrowth</a>, it contrasts the dominant application of modern web-based technologies as means for expanding influence, and instead presents these technologies as tools for community placemaking and deep listening.</p>
                    By grounding digital communication technology in physical presence, Dodder brings attention to the interconnections between these technologies and our living ecosystems. Therein, this archive is an invitation to re-relate to web technologies through a lens of socio-ecological care.<br><br>

                    <p>snowsdwellings.online is a website I created for sharing my poetry and sound experiments. I designed this space to embody decomposition, friction, chaos, and slowness - which are integral within my experience of writing poetry and creating music. I wanted to build an alternative to mainstream content streaming platforms, which standardize listening/viewing experiences and reinforce the attention economy.</p>
